#RPI Sodexo Menu Scraper
##Purpose:
Scrapes the RPI Sodexo Dining Hall menus.

##Usage:
1. Download [Python 3.x](http://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python Download Page") .
2. Install Python 3.x
3. Compile sodexo_dining_hall_menu.py
4. Output is sent to output.json which are either rewritten or added to the directory.

###Output:
output.json contains data in JSON format created by Python's Standard JSON Library.
WARNING!!!
As of September 2014, Sodexo has changed the formatting of their menu sites and the current code does not work because of this! Modifications to the code will the rolled out as they are finished!
UPDATE: It seems that the Sodexo HTML code is way more broken than I originally thought.

##Licensing:

##Q&A:
Coming soon.
